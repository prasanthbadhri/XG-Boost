# XG-Boost

XGBoost is a machine learning algorithm that belongs to the ensemble learning category, specifically the gradient boosting framework. It utilizes decision trees as base learners and employs regularization techniques to enhance model generalization. XGBoost is famous for its computational efficiency, offering efficient processing, insightful feature importance analysis, and seamless handling of missing values.

XGBoost, or eXtreme Gradient Boosting, is a machine learning algorithm under ensemble learning. It is trendy for supervised learning tasks, such as regression and classification. XGBoost builds a predictive model by combining the predictions of multiple individual models, often decision trees, in an iterative manner.

The algorithm works by sequentially adding weak learners to the ensemble, with each new learner focusing on correcting the errors made by the existing ones. It uses a gradient descent optimization technique to minimize a predefined loss function during training.

Key features of XGBoost Algorithm include its ability to handle complex relationships in data, regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and incorporation of parallel processing for efficient computation.

**Why Ensemble Learning?**
XGBoost is an ensemble learning method. Sometimes, it may not be sufficient to rely upon the results of just one machine learning model. Ensemble learning offers a systematic solution to combine the predictive power of multiple learners. The resultant is a single model which gives the aggregated output from several models.

The models that form the ensemble, also known as base learners, could be either from the same learning algorithm or different learning algorithms. Bagging and boosting are two widely used ensemble learners. Though these two techniques can be used with several statistical models, the most predominant usage has been with decision trees.
